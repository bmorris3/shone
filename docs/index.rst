shone
=====

Fast radiative transfer in JAX.

shone provides:
    - tools for efficiently downloading, storing, and interpolating pre-computed opacities
    - atmospheres with or without equilibrium chemistry
    - emission spectra of stars and planets
    - planetary transmission spectra
    - **compiled** and **autodifferentiable** models for inference
